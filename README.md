# parrot

A minimal macOS dictation daemon. Push-to-talk, on-device transcription, text inserted at the cursor.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://digimata.github.io/parrot/install.sh | sh
parrot setup                       # grants mic + accessibility, downloads the model
parrot install --launch-at-login   # optional — runs in the background on login
```

**Requires:** macOS 14+ on Apple Silicon (M1 or newer). Transcription runs on the Apple Neural Engine via CoreML — so the installer refuses to run on Intel.

The installer drops the binary in `/usr/local/bin/parrot`. Builds are unsigned for now, so the installer strips the quarantine xattr — once you've inspected the script you'll see exactly what it does.

## How to use

1. **Run it.** Either `parrot install --launch-at-login` (daemonized, runs forever, lives in the menu bar), or `parrot` in any terminal tab.
2. **Click into the text field you want to dictate into** — Messages, the address bar, a Slack thread, anywhere a cursor blinks.
3. **Hold the `fn` key, speak, release.** A small pill appears at the bottom of the screen while the mic is hot.
4. **The transcript types itself in at the cursor** when you release. Usually within 200-300ms.

That's it. There is no record button, no stop button, no "send" — `fn` is the whole interface.

> **Note:** on most modern Macs the `fn` key is the bottom-left key. If yours is set to "Change input source" or "Show emoji & symbols," `parrot setup` will tell you how to flip it back to plain `fn`.

## CLI

```sh
parrot                                 # run in the foreground (^C to quit)
parrot setup                           # one-time setup: permissions + model download
parrot install --launch-at-login       # register a LaunchAgent (background daemon)
parrot install --uninstall             # remove the LaunchAgent
parrot doctor                          # check permissions + fn key setting
parrot models list                     # list available models
parrot models download <id>            # pre-download a model
parrot --model whisper-large-v3-turbo  # bigger, multilingual, slower first-run
parrot --hotkey right-option           # change the push-to-talk key
parrot --toggle                        # tap to start, tap again to stop (default: hold)
parrot --no-overlay                    # disable the bottom-of-screen pill
```

## Restart the daemon

The LaunchAgent keeps the flags you passed to `parrot install`. To set them, reinstall with the flags you want:

```sh
parrot install --launch-at-login --hotkey right-command --toggle
```

To restart the daemon with those saved flags (works whether it is running or stopped):

```sh
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.digimata.parrot
```

The saved flags live in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.digimata.parrot.plist`. Logs go to `/tmp/parrot.out.log` and `/tmp/parrot.err.log`.
